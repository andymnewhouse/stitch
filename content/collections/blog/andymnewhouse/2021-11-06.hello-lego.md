        text: 'I''ve loved playing and building with these plastic bricks as long as I can remember. Though during high school, college, and my early 20s I did have a dark age, where I hardly acknowledged my love, thankfully this ended in 2018 when I bought myself two modular buildings for my birthday. Since then I''ve reacquired much of my childhood collection and added to the collection. Over the past two years I''ve been working to create a LEGO city called Bricksburg. To share my work and progress I''ve created an Instagram called @andysbricksburg as well as a YouTube channel where I share stop-motion build videos.'
