title: 'Hello Activism'
intro: '<p>My journey to calling myself an activist has been a long and rambling one. When I first came out as a lesbian my senior year in high school, I didn&#039;t want that fact to drastically change my life. I still wanted to wear a dress at my wedding, I still wanted to have a stereotypical wedding and lead a similar life to the one my parents lead. In short I wanted to lead my life as a &#039;&#039;happens-to-be-gay&#039;&#039;.</p>'
