        text: 'My gender identity is something I''ve been working through for some time. But basically to me it means that I don''t really feel like I am female or male but something in-between. In life things are hardly ever black or white, so why does gender need to be?'

        text: 'As a result of my midwest-nice upbringing, accepting my non-binary gender identity was hard because I didn''t want to make folks feel bad for messing up my pronouns or assuming that I''m female. However, I''ve grown to realize it does really hurt me when people, after knowing my identity, don''t attempt to change from she to they pronouns or shift from Andrea to Andy (a nickname I''ve been going by for 18+ years). Thus I''m trying to be more vocal about my gender identity and stick up for myself when I feel uncomfortable. '
