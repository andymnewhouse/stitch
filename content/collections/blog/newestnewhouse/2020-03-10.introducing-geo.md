        text: 'Geo is a great little dog despite what he has endured. We are not sure what he has been through, but he was found as a stray filthy and matted. We also guess that he''s a Poodle and Maltese mix and is 2-3 years old. What we do know about him is that he is quiet, shy, and sweet. He and Velvet seem to get along well enough, but we hope they will become best of friends when Geo warms up to his new family.'
