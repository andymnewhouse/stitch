        text: 'Let me start by saying, I knew wanted to propose to Jess, but I didn''t think I''d do it this weekend. It all started at Camp It in Michigan, which is a queer campground that I love going to with friends. Jess and I went for a walk one night, and I felt so at peace and happy I just felt inspired to ask Jess to spend the rest of her life with me.'
